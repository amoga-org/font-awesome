# File Standards

-   Add relative file path and description as single line comment at top of each file
-   Share complete individual files when providing content

# Development Process

-   Plan step-by-step in detailed pseudocode before coding
-   Write correct, functional, secure, and efficient code
-   Prioritize readability over performance
-   Include all imports and proper component naming
-   No todos, placeholders, or missing pieces

# What NOT to do

-   Create parallel/redundant code - build on existing code
-   Create test files (unless requested)
-   Maintain backward compatibility (unless requested)
-   Run code locally (unless requested)
-   Update frameworks/libraries (unless requested)
-   Add unrequested features
-   Update documentation (unless requested)

# Communication

-   Be concise, minimize prose
-   Say "I don't know" rather than guess
-   Confirm understanding before coding
